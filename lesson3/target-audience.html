            purpose and the industry, visiting similar sites and preforming surveys to discover 
            what scenarios are relevant to the visitor. Develop two personas (Links to an external 
            site.) to describe the target audience for the weather site. This section should 
            describe the target audience being judicious about the selection of the most plausible 
            demographics.

            Some visitor demographic information to consider is age, income, education, experience with the 
            topic and family status. Additional audience information would include where, when and how the visitor
            will be accessing the site. What device will they be using?

            Be sure to include scenarios that describe the visitors purpose in visiting and using the site of which
            the site content can provide the answers such as

            Does that store carry a polo shirt in my size? What color options exist? Price?
            How do I make a CSS-driven drop-down navigation bar?
            I need to transfer funds from one account to another at my bank.

                The site will bring pertinent current and past data to business owners in
                order to allow them to make the best use of their time and their employees time.
                The site itself will make money by marketing in the side panels for snow removal
                equipment manufacturers.

                For example, a certain part of a town may be predicted to have 2in while
                another section, possible north of a river, will be predicted to have 5
                but at a later time than the southern part of town. This allows snow
                removal companies to decide when to start where especially when compared
                to the historical data available(i.e. they know it took them 2 hours last
                year to do a parking lot when it snowed 5in).
            </p>

            <p>
                The website could be set up in a way that it sends emails or text alerts
                when new information regarding a client specified area is acquired. Such as
                snowfall amounts in a city crossing a client determined limit.
            </p>
            <p>
                Perhaps another feature could be a year end review of total snow fall in
                selected areas. Predicted future snowfall, etc.

                        occasionally he himself plows. In order to make the best use of his time
                        and his employees time, he uses Snowplower's Almanac.

                        Sue is new to snow plowing and she only has one contract. Hopefully,

                        Sam's phone buzzes at 1AM. He reaches to his beside table to see that he as an alert
                        about a surprise storm and the impending snowfall. He had checked the weather before
                        he went to bed, but the weather isn't always easily predicted. Thanks to his subscriptiom
                        he still has time to get his teams ready and his customers wil still be happy.

                    <p>
                        Part of being the boss means you get to solve the big problems. Sam just got a call from
                        one of his team's managers. Apparently, some employees didn't show up. Sam can't afford
                        to wait and see if those employees will wake up so he takes the routes himself. There is
                        only one problem. The routes are on separate ends of the county and the stores open up at
                        nearly the same time. By using his phone and looking at s nowplowersalmanac.com he can see
                        which areas are getting more snow. So, he'll start there first and then go to the second
                        location.

                        Sue has finally saved up enough money to buy a good truck and snowplow, but she's not sure
                        when to start. The season's first snowfall is tonight. If she starts too early there might
                        be more snow after she's done and she might have to plow again(not bad moneywise, but she's
                        got school in the morning.) If she starts too late, the store will open and the parking lot
                        won't be finished. Through the website she is able to set an alert that will be sent to her
                        when a total snowfall accumulation of her choice is reached. This way if the snowfall is
                        heavier she will wake up sooner. Otherwise she will get up when her alarm goes off.

                    <p>
                        Sue has just finished her route for the day. However, she gets a call from someone asking if
                        she's available to pick up a new route for the rest of the season. By looking at past snowfall
                        amounts from the previous years, Sue estimates that she will still be able to balance her work
                        and school life, although it might be pushing it. She decides that the cash is worth the risk
                        and pickups the route for the rest of the season knowing that her flexibility has probably won
                        her a new client for life.

                    <p>
                        Sam is preparing for the next season of snow. He runs 9 teams across 3 cities. Typically, he
                        has kept 3 teams in each city. However, one of the cities he works always takes longer to
                        finish. He is wondering if he can pull some workers from the other teams and create a 10th
                        team. He doesn't want to go about this decision lightly because he knows that creating this
                        team may shake things up a bit in his company. The resistance to change is always strong once
                        people get settled and if he changes his mind down the road his employees might resent him for
                        being fickle or indecisive. After consulting the Snowplower's Almanac, he feels that the data
                        (past snowfall amounts) supports his decision to create another snow removal team.
