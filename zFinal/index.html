                    We're proud to announce that our newest location will be in Rome, Italy!
                    Since the LDS Church disclosed that one of the latest addtions to list of
                    LDS temples across the globe would be in Rome, we have been eager to open
                    a new branch. Coming in the spring 2021, the Rome Italy branch will be ready
                    to serve the patrons of and visitors of Rome. Our newest addition to our company
                    will include many upgrades.
                </p>
                <h2>The Histoy of the Rome, Italy Temple</h2>
                <p>
                    The Rome, Italy temple was announced on October 4, 2008, however, it was not dedicated
                    until March of 2019. This extreme length of time was addressed by the Church in January 2015.
                    The some contractors were having difficulties unrelated to the project and new contractors were
                    shortly thereafter flown to Rome in an attempt to remedy the situation. Construction continued
                    to be slow after it proved difficult to obtain visas for the individuals working the temple.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The design of the this temple a special Italian marble throughout the building including the
                    walls, floors and countertops. The work is themed after Michelangelo's design at the Piazza
                    del Campidoglio.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The temple complex has built within it a stake center, a visitor's center, a family history center,
                    and throughout the complex are well-maintained gardens.
